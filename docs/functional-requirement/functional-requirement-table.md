# Functional Requirement Table

| ID      | Feature                              | Description | Acceptance Criteria |
|---------|--------------------------------------|-------------|---------------------|
| LRP-001 | New Device Detection                 | Explain the criteria for device recognition (browser fingerprint, device ID) and how trusted devices are managed. | - System accurately identifies a new browser fingerprint or device ID upon login.<br>- System differentiates between known and unknown devices. |
| LRP-002 | Email Notification for New Device Login | Details about email content (login account, device, date, location, IP address), sender, subject, and frequency (once per new device login). | - Email is sent immediately after successful login from a new device.<br>- Email contains all specified login details.<br>- Email is sent only once per unique new device login session. |
| LRP-003 | Security Action Link                 | Specify the link's validity period (7 days) and its redirection target to the interactive confirmation page. | - Link is present in the email.<br>- Link is unique per notification and non-guessable.<br>- Link remains valid for 7 days from email dispatch.<br>- Link correctly redirects to the interactive confirmation page. |
| LRP-004 | Interactive Confirmation Page Display | Describe the page's content, layout, and the options presented ("Is this you?"). Ensure it explicitly shows the user's account and latest login details. | - Confirmation page loads without requiring re-authentication.<br>- Page accurately displays relevant login information (account, device, date, time, location).<br>- Page presents clear "Yes, that's me" and "No, that's not me" options. |
| LRP-005 | Confirm Login and Trust Device        | Explain the impact of this action on future notifications from the same device. | - Clicking "Yes, that's me" confirms the current login session.<br>- The device's fingerprint/ID is added to the user's trusted device list.<br>- Subsequent logins from the same trusted device do not trigger email notifications. |
| LRP-006 | Account Security Options Presentation | Detail the options presented ("Change Password," "Block Account Temporarily") and the immediate actions taken for each. | - Clicking "No, that's not me" presents the "Change Password" and "Block Account Temporarily" options. |
| LRP-007 | Password Change Redirection           | Describe the initiation of the password reset flow from this context. | - User is successfully redirected to the designated password reset page.<br>- The password reset process can be completed successfully from this redirection. |
| LRP-008 | Temporary Account Block               | Specify the "view mode" limitations (e.g., no transactional actions, only viewing data) and the exact text/format of the contact admin prompt. Also, mention the additional notification sent to the user. | - User account permissions are immediately set to view-only mode.<br>- A clear prompt instructing the user to contact the administrator is displayed.<br>- An additional notification (e.g., email) is sent to the user confirming the account block/permission limitation. |
| LRP-009 | Graceful Handling of Unconfirmed Logins | State that the login remains confirmed in such scenarios, with no impact on user access or account status. | - No account restrictions or punitive actions are applied if the security link expires or the email is ignored.<br>- The initial login from the new device remains valid and active. |
| LRP-010 | Post-MFA Triggering                   | Clarify the order of operations in the authentication flow, ensuring this feature runs only post-MFA. | - MFA is successfully completed by the user *before* the new device detection logic runs.<br>- The Login Recovery feature does not interfere with or bypass the MFA process. |
| LRP-011 | Inactive Account Warning Notification | The system must automatically send a warning notification to users whose accounts are approaching the 60-day inactivity limit. | 1. A scheduled process runs automatically to identify accounts that have been inactive for a predefined period (e.g., 53 days).<br>2. An email notification is sent to the registered email of the identified user.<br>3. The email clearly states that the account is scheduled for deactivation due to inactivity and specifies the deactivation date.<br>4. The notification is sent only once per deactivation warning cycle. |
| LRP-012 | Automated Inactive Account Deactivation | The system must automatically change the status of accounts that have been inactive for more than 60 consecutive days to "deactivated." | 1. A scheduled process runs automatically to identify accounts with no login activity for over 60 days.<br>2. The status of identified accounts is changed to "deactivated."<br>3. A user attempting to log into a deactivated account will be denied access and shown a message indicating the account has been disabled due to inactivity.<br>4. The deactivation process revokes login privileges but does not permanently delete the user's data. |
